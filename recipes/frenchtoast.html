            <li>In a saucepan, stir together the brown sugar, butter and water.
                Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes,
                stirring frequently.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the brown sugar mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and tilt the
                dish to cover the entire bottom. Place peaches in a layer over the sugar
                coating, then top with slices of French bread. In a medium bowl, whisk
                together the eggs and vanilla. Slowly pour over the bread slices to coat
                evenly. Sprinkle cinnamon over the top. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours
                or overnight.
            </li>

                come to room temperature. Preheat the over to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bread is
